# Flying whales - dramatic elements

Flying whale is a game where you control a pack of whales in an attempt to stop global pollution against multiple adversaries.

The player will have to strategically decide how to approach every obstacle in order to complete every stage of the game and in the end the player and his pack of whales will save the world.

## Challenges

In order for the player to complete the game, he will have to think strategically, for every stage will impose a different challenge.
For example will the player try to attack his enemies or defend against them? Try to gather powerups or finish the stage as fast as possible?
Every player will find his own way to play the game but at the end not all of them will succeed.

Because Flying Whales is a real time game, the player will also need to display fast thinking in order to handle multiple threats at the same time. Players who are going to stall will suffer the consequences.

The game can offer multiple levels of difficulties to manually choose from as shown below:

|                           | Easy      | Medium  | Hard      |
|---------------------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Number of starting whales | Increased | Default | Decreased |
| Spawn rate of powerups    | Increased | Default | Decreased |
| Difficulty of enemies     | Increased | Default | Decreased |

The number of whales are the effective amount of lives the player has, meaning the player dies when the last whale does. The number of whales can also effect multiple stats of the player such as attack power and more. The player will have the ability to find new whales during the game to help grow stronger.

The game offers multiple powerups for the player, which are going to be spawned on stage every certain amount of time. To increase difficulty, the powerups spawn rate is going to be lowered.

During the game the player will fight multiple enemies, every one of them with different mechanics. The harder the difficulty the higher the stats of the enemies (For example attack speed, amount of enemies, health point etc).

To increase the difficulty of the game dynamically, we will have to approach the challenges of the game in a different rate. Flying Whales world is split into segments, each segment is a stage by itself. The higher the stage the higher the difficulty will be, as the player will learn the game mechanics and strategy. This is an important part of the game mechanic, that's designed to keep the player challenged.

The higher the stage the difficulty of the enemies rises and the amount of in-game resources that are offered to the player will be lowered.

## Flow

To keep the game flowing and the player focused, we have multiple ways of doing so.
Every stage's objective is going to be clear to the player to keep the game progress flowing.

Minimal user interface- To keep the player focused on the game, the player's UI will be minimal, only showing relevant information at all times.

Immersion-With high quality graphics and storyline, the player will be drawn inside the game's world.

The player's action will have immediate effects on the game settings, such as an effective attack to defeat an enemy or collecting a powerup to increase speed-every action will show the player exactly what he did.

Gameplay will be rewarding-good players will be rewarded with higher scores and satisfaction from beating the game's higher difficulties. This also increases the game's playability.
Wrong choices will make the player to lose resources, such as powerups, whales and even game over. All of those will have immediate effect on the player's feel of the game.

## Amusement

Flying Whales is about saving the world, simply by playing it helps raise awareness about such issue, making the game valuable for a reason other than passing time.

The game fits for all ages. Increase of difficulties ensures that all players will find challenges while playing the game and the game's goal should interest us all as human beings living on this planet.

The game in nature is children friendly, but can be made for more adult audience by adding violence and bloody effects to the game.

## Feelings

The player controls a pack of whales and every time he loses one he's attack power will be reduced. When the last whale dies the player will lose. This type of system will help the player feel connected to the game, more specific to the whales themselves, because every whale the player has increases his chance of victory, every one of them counts.

The enemies of Flying Whale ruins the planet and the whales habitat, so defeating them feels more rewarding other than progressing the game, all of that is thanks to the plot.

The game's graphic will be cute and appealing, helping the player be emotionally attached to every one of his whales.

## Backstory

The world of Flying Whales is a peaceful world, full of live and variant creates. The whales wandered around peacefully enjoying the world's content, until aliens attacked the planet to extract resources disregarding its habitats.
The whales couldn't let that happens, so they gathered a group to help restore the peace of the planet.

To convey the story to the player, a short cutscene will show the world in its peaceful state, then when the aliens land and the destruction they brought.
When the player progresses through the game he will reveal the real damage the aliens have done until the last stage where they defeat the enemies.

Those side character will thank the player for every region of the game he clears, restoring pace for them.

## World building

The Flying Whales world revolves around its environment and habitats, where the player's goal is to restore balance and peace among them. The world's creatures are at peace with one another and this is one of the motivations for the whales (and the player) to act against the intrusion of the aliens.

While progressing through the game the player will be exposed to different parts of the world and will meet different kind of creatures, which at the end of every stage they will interact with one another slowly revealing the plot of the game.
